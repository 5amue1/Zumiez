# Visual Analytics of Zumiez Complete Skateboards Selection

Due to COVID, I have been sitting indoors, trying to distance myself from the hundreds of party goers in this little college town. To free my mind up a little, I took up skateboarding and have been trying to learn how to skateboard in the mornings, while everyone else is class. Choosing a skateboard to start off with was a challenge and the Complete Skatebords on Zumiez intrigued me (https://www.zumiez.com/skate/complete-skateboards.html). However, there was no way for me to compare the options available or see what the inventory looked like as a whole. 

For this reason, I have taken it upon myself to scrape the data regarding Completes from the Zumiez website i try and visualize their collection, to make it easier for other budding skateboarders to make a descision. This is an ongoing project and will be updated over the next few weeks.

Part 1 - Webscrape Zumiez Complete Skateboards data - Complete
Part 2 - Data Cleaning - Complete
Part 3 - Create database in Postgres and evaluate data - In progress
Part 4 - Crate dashboards that can be shared with the public - In queue
